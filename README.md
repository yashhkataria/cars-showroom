# cars-showroom
A simple cars showroom project made using Python and MySQL


In order to run the project, you need MySQL installed on your system.

In the 7th line of the code, change the password to your MySQL password. Then only a connection will be established.

Make sure to put the car.png file in the same directory as the code otherwise the code will not compile.

In MySQL, you need to have a database named 'project' within which you must have two tables namely 'car_detail' and 'owner'. The description of and sample data is given below. By default, the owner table is kept empty.
